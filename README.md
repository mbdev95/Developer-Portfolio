# Developer-Portfolio
A repository showcasing my various projects as a web developer.
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my various projects I worked on as I learned how to become a competent web developer.  
Each project I completed focused on a different aspect of development, with a continual focus on mostly front-end web development, although one of the main projects I completed involved the creation of a database using mySQL.
I completed the projects as a part of a course with the online learning school openclassrooms.
Some of the main developer competencies illustrated in these projects include html, css, vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, react, object-oriented JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and mySQL.
